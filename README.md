# Team 7 - Has Left The Building

This project is structured into two main components: the frontend and the smart contracts. Below you'll find a brief overview of each part.

## Structure

This repository is divided into two main folders:

- **`react-frontend`**: This folder contains all the frontend code of the application, built using React. For more details about the frontend, please refer to the [README](<ins>react-frontend/README.md</ins>) in the `react-frontend` folder.

- **`smart-contracts`**: Here, you'll find the smart contracts that interact with the blockchain. To learn more about the smart contracts, visit the [README](<ins>smart-contracts/README.md</ins>) in the `smart-contracts` folder.

## Getting Started
